// div takes the full page and span takes only the required page
// inside the div we use padding & outside the div we use margin
//if we want to navigate from one page to another after clicking the button then we use "a" tag
// float-left, float-right etc use to place the elements to respective positions
// to position children use flex-box - right , left etc
// to keep two children's equally apart from each other we use justify-content: space-between
// keeping div if we want  to add a text next to each other we use display-flex
